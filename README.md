Methodology:

1: Extract training data from various different Finance and Climate glossaries to train our Naive Bayes model. Though this model will not be 100% accurate, it will give us a start and tell us whether each page in the report leans more towards Climate or Finane.
2: Install various failsales functions such as scanning for specific words and extracting sentences with those words. This will give us sentences that we may want to look into. 
3: Only take into account pages who are Climate positive (Naive Bayes) and include environment words.
